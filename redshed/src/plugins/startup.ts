 * Vue/VueX have the concept of lifecycle hooks for individual components,

 *
 * It is a common use case for plugins or VueX stores to immediately fetch data.
 * `install()` functions for plugins are called before the Vue/VueX instances are created.
 * Inserting store data at that point will throw an error.
 *
 * As a solution, plugins can register callbacks here.
 * They will be called in the App.vue `created()` hook.
